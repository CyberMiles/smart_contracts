This example is about deploying a simple samrt contract on Travis Testnet.
The source code 'HelloWorld.sol' is also in the directory.

The contract has two main methods: sayHello() and updateMessage(). 
sayHello() returns a greeting message to its caller which is initially set to 'Hello, World' when the Smart Contract is deployed.  
updateMessage() allows the method caller to change the greeting message to another message passed by function parameter (type bytes32).

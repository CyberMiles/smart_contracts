# CryptoKitties -- an open source smart contract based game on blockchain 

In this example, we will be deploying a style game that is originally on Ethereum onto Travis. 

CryptoKitties is a game for buying (through auction), selling (also through auction), and breeding digital cats. Although each cat is represented by `uint256` as genetic code in Solidity, there is a CryptoKittyâ€™s web server visualizing the cats. But now we are only focusing on the smart contracts that functionally consist the game.
